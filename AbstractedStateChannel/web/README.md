# A Guide on Using the Tic Tac Toe User Interface

## Getting Started
In order to use the Tic Tac Toe interface to play a real live game of Tic Tac Toe on Abstracted State Channels, you will either need to have [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth) running. However, for demonstrational purposes (and to get a feel of how to use the interface), it is ideal to instead have [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) running.

Note: Remember to unlock any account that you are planning to use to play
